            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Food for All is a non-profit organization that aims to end hunger and reduce food waste by redistributing excess food from restaurants, grocery stores, and other food establishments to people in need.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to create a sustainable food system that benefits everyone by reducing food waste and providing healthy and nutritious food to people in need.</p>
            <p>We work with local food establishments and volunteers to collect, sort, and distribute food to homeless shelters, food banks, and other organizations that serve people in need.</p>
            <p>Food for All was founded in 2015 by a group of food industry professionals who wanted to make a difference in their community. Since then, we have grown to serve over 10,000 people every month and have diverted millions of pounds of food from landfills.</p>
